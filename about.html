							<h1>Melanie Adele Martinez</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/MelSig.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Was born April 28, 1995. is an American singer, songwriter, actress and director. Born in Astoria, Queens, and raised in
							Baldwin, New York, Martinez rose to fame in 2012 after appearing on season 3 of the American television talent show The
							Voice.</p>
							
							<p>Melanie Adele Martinez was born on April 28, 1995 in Astoria, Queens, to parents Mery and Jose Martinez,
							who are of Dominican and Puerto Rican descent. Her family moved to Baldwin, New York, on Long Island, when
							Martinez was four.
							
							Martinez attended Plaza Elementary School, crediting her teacher Mr. Nadien with teaching her how to sing, and in
							kindergarten, Martinez began writing poetry. Martinez says she had few friends growing up and was a homebody, as she
							was "very emotional" and found it difficult to explain her feelings, crying when overwhelmed. She practiced
							photography and painting. Due to her emotionality as a child,she says that others referred to her as a "cry
							baby", which sparked the creation of the titular character of her debut album, Cry Baby.
							
							Martinez grew up in a "traditional Latin household" where she was made to feel shameful about talking about her
							sexuality and felt as if she would not be accepted if she came out as bisexual. She says that her family is now fully
							accepting of her sexuality.
							
							At fourteen, Martinez taught herself how to play guitar by studying chord diagrams of songs she enjoyed, which she found
							online, and wrote her first song by adding her poetry to one of the chord diagrams, but says that playing guitar
							"eventually got stale". Martinez graduated from Baldwin High School.</p>
							<p>Martinez's music has been described as pop, alternative pop, art pop, electropop, and dark
							pop. Cry Baby and K–12 were seen to have hip hop and R&B undertones. Portals saw Melanie venturing into
							experimental sounds and pop-rock. Martinez's music has been described by The Guardian as "off-kilter, sweary
							electropop". Rolling Stone described Martinez's music as "twisted lullabies about love, danger and madness", and
							compared her music to that of "'Coin-Operated Boy'-era Dresden Dolls" and Lana Del Rey. The New York Times's Jon
							Pareles described her music as "perch[ing] prettily tinkling keyboards and concise pop choruses amid the slow, ominous
							basslines and twitchy percussion of Southern hip-hop – a candy-coated variation on the dirges of Lorde and Lana Del
							Rey", and described her mezzo-soprano voice[93][94] as "whispery, sardonic, tearful, and furious". Billboard's
							Jason Lipshutz also compared Martinez to Del Rey and Lorde, saying, "Martinez is clearly cribbing from the dimly lit pop
							stylings of Lorde and Lana Del Rey, but while her wispy delivery strikes the same femme fatale poses, she lacks the
							subtlety of her influences", and that "Martinez is admirably ambitious, but her insistence on sticking to Cry Baby's
							central idea leaves her contorting into uncomfortable positions".
							
							Martinez describes her alter ego and the protagonist of her debut album, Cry Baby, as a "fairy tale" version of
							herself. Martinez's songs are often based on personal experiences. Martinez described her own music as "very
							dark and honest" and "hip hop/trap inspired beats with creepy nostalgic childlike sounds such as baby pianos, music
							boxes, and toys"</p>
							
							<p>Martinez listened to Christina Aguilera, Brandy, Britney Spears, The Beatles, Tupac Shakur, Shakira, and Biggie Smalls
							growing up, and wanted to be a singer from a young age. Martinez has cited The Beatles, Neutral
							Milk Hotel, Feist, Kimbra, Zooey Deschanel, Regina Spektor, and CocoRosie as influences of hers. Specific albums
							which have influenced her music include The Idler Wheel... by Fiona Apple and Ariana Grande's albums Yours Truly and My
							Everything. She attributes the "heavy hip-hop influence" in her music to her father playing hip-hop music in the
							family's house often during her childhood.
							
							The visuals in Martinez's music videos have been influenced by her favorite visual artists: Mark Ryden, Aleksandra
							Waliszewska and Nicoletta Ceccoli. She named Tim Burton as a large influence of hers, and has said that to make
							a movie with him would be her "one dream".</p>
							<p>At age sixteen, after watching 101 Dalmatians, Martinez dyed half of her hair blonde, in the same vein as Cruella de
							Vil. She became known for the look, as well as her "baby doll"-inspired outfits in music videos and when
							performing. The Guardian has called her image "doll-like and decidedly emo" while her music is best
							known to be "part-nursery rhyme, part tragic life story".</p>
